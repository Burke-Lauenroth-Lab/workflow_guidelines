# R Documentation Checklist

- Are the arguments (@param) in order (as they are called in the function)?
- Is there one @param for each argument call in the function?
- Is there a grammatically correct sentence describing each argument/return/side effect?
- Does each @param/return/sideeffect have units?
  * Units should be written in scientific format (cm/day)

TO DO - add more.
